Question:
What type of extracurricular activities help with employment

Thesis: 
Extra Curricular activities help with employment.

Functional Requirement:
>Displays a Column Chart where the extracurricular attendance is compared to employment across different departments.
>Displays my progress from gathering data and creating simple charts to making the final product.
>Tests if my hypothesis is true

Using the Information above, I wrote all my findings below:


Extracurricular participation plays a significant role in shaping students’ post-school employment prospects. This means that students who engage in activities beyond the classroom such as sports, music, leadership roles, or clubs tend to develop transferable skills that enhance their employability. These experiences foster teamwork, time management, and communication, which are highly valued in the workforce. For instance, a 2023 report by the NSW Department of Education
highlighted that students involved in structured extracurricular programs were 25% more likely to secure part-time or full-time employment within six months of graduation. Similarly, interviews conducted with Gosford High School students revealed that those active in cadet training or music ensembles felt more confident applying for jobs and navigating interviews. Just as rehearsing for a
musical performance builds discipline and adaptability, participating in extracurriculars prepares students for the unpredictability and collaboration required in real-world employment. These activities act as a preparation stage for life after school, equipping students with
the skills that academic grades alone cannot measure.

Data Dictionary:
Department|String|"Political Science", "Economics"|What the student is learning at university
Extra|String|"Yes" / "No"|Indicates whether the student participates in extracurricular activities
Job|String|"Yes" / "No"|Indicates whether the student is currently employed


Extracurricular involvement appears to positively influence student employment outcomes,
as demonstrated by the comparative data analysis across departments. This means that departments with higher rates of extracurricular participation also tend to show higher employment rates among students, suggesting a meaningful correlation between the two. For example, in the dataset analyzed,
the Computer science and Engineering department exhibited both high extracurricular engagement and strong employment figures, while departments with lower participation showed weaker employment outcomes. This pattern reinforces the idea that extracurricular activities help students build skills that are valued in the workforce. This proves that involvement in extracurriculars equips students with the confidence and adaptability needed to succeed in job environments.
The analysis confirms the hypothesis, though further research could explore additional
variables such as academic performance or socioeconomic background to deepen the findings.

Peer Evaluations:

Marlon: 
P-  Charts are well defined and clearly relevant data. Multiple charts help to show the data better. Saving figures works 
M- Error handling isn't the best
I- Program works quite well, and the UI functions well. The UX works fine. Overall a pretty good effort 

Sidd:
P- The Charts are very easy to understand and the UX and UI works well
M- There could be more charts to display more data
I- Program works very well.

Benji: 
P- The charts are very easy to understand and works as it should.
M- There could be more charts to help compare the researched question
I- Both the UI and UX works well.

Project Evaluation:

Overall, I felt that my project was a success, with a few minor problems along the way.
I started off with a very broad question, then narrowed it down. I encountered a roadblock trying to find a dataset and thankfully Sir helped me find the dataset that suits the criteria of the problem I was researching. From there, I worked at a moderate pace and fixed most problems with ease. I feel like my code fits the criteria and in terms of the data, it was accurate and easy to understand.
